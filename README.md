# MFPV (ModularFPV or Modular First Person View Drone System)
## Modular Open-Source 3D-Printed Frame System for FPV-based (4"-5") drones
### Designed for the 2024 Technology Student Association (TSA) UAV Challenge and Hack Club Arcade. This meets all physcial and safety requirements for TSA.

### This system fits standard FPV parts and is relatively easy to work on. It comprises of mostly standard mounting other than the modular connector.

## Features and Specs:
 - Fully 3D-printed (other than hardware) 
 - Support for 5" propellers 
 - No glue required! (other than RX mounting)
 - Modular mounting on the bottom frame
 - Space for most Analog/Digital FPV cameras (Mounting not included, will require a custom designed solution)
 - Cooling for critical components
 - Super easy and quick to print (About 3 hours on “Next-gen" printers. Closer to 6-9hrs on slower printers)
 - Also doesn't require much fine-tuning due to very relaxed tolerances. 
 - Easy to acquire hardware (just any M3 screw and standoff kit will work, round head works best)
 - Easy routing for XT60 wires/most other cables
 - Uses roughly ~70g of filament for the frame (About 200g total for the entire platform)
 - Super easy to make brackets for
 - Can be printed on beds the same as or larger than an i3 (at least 220mm x 175mm)
 - No post processing (assuming your printer has no issues)
 - STL and STEP files for printing and design changes.
    * Use the OnShape public link before using the STEP files.
    * Use the STEP files only if you're on other CAD systems (Fusion, Inventor, ect)
## Compatible Parts 
 - Fits 30.5mm x 30.5mm FC Stacks 
   * (Preferably SpeedyBee F4 or F7 line “full size” stacks)
 - Fits 20mm x 20mm Analog VTX
   * Built around the SpeedyBee TX800, but most should work.
 - Fits 16x16mm motors
   * Fits 2207 or larger natively.
   * Could fit smaller motors (2203, 2203.5, 2205) with adapters or changes of the B frame.  
 - Fits SMA adapters 
 - Hole for RX antenna 
 - Fits battery straps 
   * (Designed around 4S Li-Ion packs but will fit most small-medium Li-Po packs)
